### The problem
Nowadays everyone has many bank accounts. Each account is intended for its own purpose. For example, account for salary or for daily expenses. Maybe you have an account for your own savings. It often happens that a person begins to confuse between accounts. Sometimes it turns out that the account owner stops monitoring his finances, and, after that, he does not have money for something important.
